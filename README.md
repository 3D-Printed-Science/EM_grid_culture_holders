# EM_grid_culture_holders
STL and design files for 3d printable EM grid holders to simplifiy on-grid cell culture 

## Printing advice
### FDM
I print 30 holders at a time with layer thickness 0.12mm in PLA, flat on the build plate. PLA is very biocompatible. 

### Resin
I print 50 holders at a time with layer thickness 0.035mm in autoclavable resin, lifted and at an angle.

## Usage
These holders are designed to fit snugly into 35mm mattek dishes with 14mm cutouts for microscopy. We sterilize PLA holders using only UV in the TC hood. Resin printers can make autoclavable parts, but its important to identify biocompatible resins and wash off residual resin and photocatalyst.

Up to 4 grids can be placed on each holder, each of which can be viewed through a microscope and easily picked up with tweezers thanks to the slot. This allows for reduced dead time between potential treatment and freezing (since lifting grids off of the mattek glass can be inconsistent).
